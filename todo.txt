=================
=== DEBATABLE ===

* compile-time substitutions:
  right now there is no way to mutate a variable
  using its value
  { x 10 } => x = 10
  but how to make it 9 or 11?
  it is related to some kind of "value copy"
  or assignment by value (now only by name)

* should compiler remove comments or not?
  it can really help to save space, but will
  leave words without documentation inside
  E4 code (so SEE word can not fetch whole definition)

* soft (shy) definitions:
  if the definition is marked in a special way,
  check if the symbol already holds an
  implementation, if it has, do not redefine word.
  can be useful for:
  1) nested words which will be evaluated only once
  2) for the "default" actions

* maybe lambdas can start with `&', and all share same
  spot in dictionary, so &action and &compare
  can override each other, but readibility is higher

============
=== MUST ===

* quotations:
  find out all behavior behinds ' ` , tokens inside
  E4 code and document it.

* recursion is simply implemented at this moment,
  but this way is not scaling well with high amounts
  of recursive calls (10 000+ already pretty slow).

* enable empty funtion body (do-nothing function?)

* name clashes are the real problem.
  something is surely needed, but I am not sure about namespaces.

=============
=== FIXME ===

* overload VEC and STR to enable convertions
  between the two

* if it is possible, rewrite collecting lambda
  with concat and vconcat; make benchmarks

* convert examples into tests

* write e4.ffi-lambda-binding

* write wrapper for getting top and pushing at stack,
  because _most_ of lambdas take one top element (or several),
  then push their into stack

* check if it is possible when we collect tokens for compiled word
  to put them reversed order (to avoid nreverse call at the end).
  if it is, check the results (measure runtime)

* DUP makes only pointer copy of sequence,
  so deep-copy builtin primitive is needed
  (or DUP should copy whole sequence by itself)

* if endif is omitted, many strange things may happen!

* implementation of multiple similar concepts lead to some code
  duplication.
