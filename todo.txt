=================
=== DEBATABLE ===

* loops:
  without interpreter support iteration kit is limited
  to recursion (not that bad), but there is also
  few ways to control the flow (sequences are good for
  small number of iterations, not for 10+ cycles)

* compile-time substitutions:
  right now there is no way to mutate a variable
  using its value
  { x 10 } => x = 10
  but how to make it 9 or 11?
  it is related to some kind of "value copy"
  or assignment by value (now only by name)

============
=== MUST ===

* vectors:
  user can define a vector using [ ] syntax,
  but there is no functions for them,
  they are useless until some language support is done

* quotations:
  find out all behavior behinds ' ` , tokens inside
  E4 code and document it.
