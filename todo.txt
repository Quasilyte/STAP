=================
=== DEBATABLE ===

* loops:
  without interpreter support iteration kit is limited
  to recursion (not that bad), but there is also
  few ways to control the flow (sequences are good for
  small number of iterations, not for 10+ cycles)

* compile-time substitutions:
  right now there is no way to mutate a variable
  using its value
  { x 10 } => x = 10
  but how to make it 9 or 11?
  it is related to some kind of "value copy"
  or assignment by value (now only by name)

* should compiler remove comments or not?
  it can really help to save space, but will
  leave words without documentation inside
  E4 code (so SEE word can not fetch whole definition)

* maybe ordering vector for shake should be replaced with
  ordering string:
  "0123" versus [0 1 2 3],
  which is shorted, not a less concise and can be
  more effective (benchmarks are needed as always).
  it is also limits indexes used to 0-9..

============
=== MUST ===

* vectors:
  user can define a vector using [ ] syntax,
  but there is no functions for them,
  they are useless until some language support is done

* quotations:
  find out all behavior behinds ' ` , tokens inside
  E4 code and document it.

=============
=== FIXME ===

* overload VEC and STR to enable convertions
  between the two

* if it is possible, rewrite collecting lambda
  with concat and vconcat; make benchmarks

* convert examples into tests

* write e4.ffi-lambda-binding

* write wrapper for getting top and pushing at stack,
  because _most_ of lambdas take one top element (or several),
  then push their into stack

* check if it is possible when we collect tokens for compiled word
  to put them reversed order (to avoid nreverse call at the end).
  if it is, check the results (measure runtime)

* check if NIP is really faster in current implementation.

* DUP makes only pointer copy of sequence,
  so deep-copy builtin primitive is needed
  (or DUP should copy whole sequence by itself)
